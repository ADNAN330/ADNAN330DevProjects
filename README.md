# ADNAN330DevProjects
It's the first repository of mine , which I'll upload my projects to. 

This is my first time using github to upload, so I don't really know what to do :)

VBook is a website for selling and creating virtual books, it was created by frontend developer Adnan hamdo.
 however, the website is nothing but a frontend project, thus it will not be working as it lacks a backend interface
